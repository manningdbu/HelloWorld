My name is Diana, I was born and raised in Massachusetts 
I have a degree in Animal Science, yes I received college credits for hanging out with goats. 
Basic is how I would describe myself, I don't find that demeaning, I don't wish to be bold.
I like to camp, hike, rock climb, play soccer, run, hang out with my cats, and beebop around.  
I'm very sarcastic so take what I say with a grain of salt.  My facial expressions say what I am thinking.
